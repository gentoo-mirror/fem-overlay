The current FeM Bitbucket is being replaced with a GitLab instance. As such,
the fem-overlay, whose upstream repository is currently located in the FeM
Bitbucket [0], will also be moved to the GitLab instance.

The new repository is:
* https://gitlab.fem-net.de/gentoo/fem-overlay.git

We will continue to mirror the fem-overlay to the old repository [0] until
2021-10-31. After that day, it is no longer guaranteed that the old repository
will be up to date and it will be removed some time later. Furthermore, the
SVN mirror [1] will also be disabled.

Depending on the overlay management tool being used (and if such a tool is
being used at all), the repository URL in /etc/portage/repos.conf might have
to be adjusted to match the new upstream URL. If in doubt, check
/etc/portage/repos.conf for any occurences of the fem-overlay, e.g.:

  $ grep -R fem-overlay /etc/portage/repos.conf

If a line pops up with the old upstream clone URL [2], edit the corresponding
file and insert the new upstream URL instead. If a line pops up, containing
the GitHub mirror URL [3], the system is not affected by this change and
nothing needs to be done.

If the URL had to be changed in repos.conf, it has to be changed in the cloned
repo as well. Assuming, the repository is cloned to /var/db/repos/fem-overlay,
run the following:

  # cd /var/db/repos/fem-overlay
  # git remote set-url origin https://gitlab.fem-net.de/gentoo/fem-overlay.git

Alternatively, you can just remove the repository so that the repository is
freshly cloned upon the next emerge --sync:

  # rm -r /var/db/repos/fem-overlay

Afterwards syncing now fetches from the new upstream repository and further
changes should not be necessary.
