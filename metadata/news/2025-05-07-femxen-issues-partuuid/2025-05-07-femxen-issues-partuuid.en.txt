Starting with grub-2.04, a new option GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_PARTUUID was added and
defaulted to 'true'. The maintainers of sys-boot/grub::gentoo have decided to
set this option to 'false' with recent config updates.

Beginning with femxen-kernel-6.6.74 this configuration can lead to the system
being unbootable. To prevent this please comment the following line in
/etc/default/grub:

   GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_PARTUUID=false

And instead uncomment the following line:

   GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_UUID=true
