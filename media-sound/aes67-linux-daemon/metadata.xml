		This is a daemon and Kernel module to allow connection of a Linux computer
		to any AES67-compatible Audio-over-IP network like Dante or Ravenna.
		The daemon allows configuring virtual ALSA devices to send and receive audio
		to and from the AES67-compatible network by simply interacting with ALSA
		as if the devices were actual sound cards,
		much like Dante Virtual Soundcard does for Windows computers in Dante networks.
